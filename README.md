# YoutubeVideoTranslate

## Update:
- Archived since Google is starting rolling this out now. I expect it to be available for everyone before this project would finish
- failed mainly because no tts AI was found that can pause on demand and specify speed/ time

## Todo:
1. get Youtube video (without sponsor) &#x2714;
2. get metadata (transscript) &#x2714;
3. translate trascript (0% done)
4. create ai voice &#x2714;
5. delete old audio &#x2714;
6. add ai voice to the video (50% done)
7. start video in mpv (98% done)
8. ElevenLabs API endpoint is probably broken since this was done in its beta 

## Dependencies
- Python
- FFmpeg
- yt-dlp
- mpv

## Setup
#### Ai voice
- get an api key from ElevenLabs

## Use:
paste youtubelink and enjoy
(maybe you will have a config to define the output langauge)
